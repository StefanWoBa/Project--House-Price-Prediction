# Project-1-EDA
This project is centered around exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques and statistical analysis, as well as modeling data using linear regression.

Building a house price prediciton model for King County.

# Going through Data Science Life Cycle:

 ## 01 Business Understanding
 ## 02 Data Mining
 ## 03 Data Cleaning
 ## 04 Data Exploration
 ## 05 Feature Engineering
 ## 06 Predictive Modeling
 ## 07 Data Visualization
 
# 3 Key Takeaways:
  * You save on average more than 30.000 USD if the house was not renovated
  * one additional view will increase the price by 23.300 USD
  * Buy a house between 1946 - 1969
  
# Future Work:
* Goodness of fit!! (loggin certain variables)
* Location as a determinant of the price regression
* Distances to certain important factors like Public Transportation or Supermarkets or Hospitals
* Rating of nearby schools
